# Diabetes Readmission supervised-ml
With the increasing cost of readmissions in the United States, One type of solution to this problem is reducing the readmission rates for diabetic patients. This will have a great potential to reduce medical cost significantly. The aim of this project is to predict the likelihood of a diabetic patient being readmitted. If we are able to predict the likely of diabetic readmissions, interventions can be provided to reduce the readmission rate.
